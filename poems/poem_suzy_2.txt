Come and sit by the blood of the seasons with fast affection
 and let me witness your beauty.
In the spirit of this song, may it rise up pure and free.
I will not be battered by misuse, misguided trust and strong abuse,
 at least the men I chose were real and had the power to love and feel.
Emotionless, apparently, but, bearing closer scrutiny, one can see
 indestructible passion to explore freely and at will."
But of all the lovers I recall...
You are "the robot".
