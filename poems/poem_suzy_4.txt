Your heart in the headlines.
Shelves at the newspaper stands overflowing with your digital love.
Go melt back down the white sand road.
Board planes to mars with engines shining.
Go fly like a stainless seagull,
 high above the outlets and electrical streams.
Go fly and when you do, Love-bot,
 the first thing I know is that the sky will be lonely.
