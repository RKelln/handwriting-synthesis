Redwood stretched. Shellfish bristled the floor.
And a masquerade of birds in limousines waited in the sky.
My radiant love-bot stood tall and said,
"Life, in even the simplest form,
 has always been a matter of finding the energy...
but you already know that, don’t you, Mister Jones?

Come and sit by the blood of the seasons with fast affection
 and let me witness your beauty.
In the spirit of this song, may it rise up pure and free.
I will not be battered by misuse, misguided trust and strong abuse,
 at least the men I chose were real and had the power to love and feel.
Emotionless, apparently, but, bearing closer scrutiny, one can see
 indestructible passion to explore freely and at will."
But of all the lovers I recall...
You are "the robot".

2:50
Love-bot, can you really feel it? Love itself?
Are you someone I can come home to when my exhausting day is through?
Count yourself a well-worn shoe?
A friend that I can slip into?

5:50
See temptation caving in me. I don’t care. I keep a little house in there.
Deep in those push-up brassieres, tight dresses and rhinestone rings.
They are simulated illusions, but Love-Bot, you got me singing.
Sweet playground swing love.

6:45
Your heart in the headlines,
Shelves at the newspaper stands overflowing with your digital love.
Go melt back down the white sand road.
Board planes to mars with engines shining.
Go fly like a stainless seagull,
 high above the outlets and electrical streams.
Go fly and when you do, Love-bot,
 the first thing I know is that the sky will be lonely.


RELIGION POEM (1ST PART):
BAR 2 - 29

Come daily to the very same
The beginning of the spiritual light
Its way
Its water line
It seems to stop trying to get

The spirit of love come on me suddenly
Climbs up to Your faith goodness when I am sad
 and feel You are precious and honored in my body
Sweet love, renew thy force; be with me
 as with that fiesta of sunset in the sight of God and man

A heart whose love is as strong as death
It does not dishonor others, it is not made perfect in love
It does not envy, it does not exist, nor You
And so we know and rely on the tablet of Your lashes
Or the wrinkled body of the sky of roses

I have been a sinful man
but teach me not forget
what hast Thou done
to seek them well

I will know Your name


LOVE POEM (2ND PART):
BAR 38 - 52

the world is a beautiful thing
just like a butterfly rose
it is like a melody
a feeling drawn to its warm heart
feeling its own way
9
i want to leave my heart up to my soul
let me be your heart and joy
embrace in your heart
you won't find a lot
just a dream
just as you walk in your light a moment in time
for love is innocent
my love is yours

love you can see
you can see
a smile in a smile
like a puma in the distant mountain tops
 and you decide to leave me at the red rare deer
four red roebuck at a green mountain
horn at hip went my love feeds on your arm
weeping may stay for the pale stones of your heart

you are you
and love
look at your heart
like a butterfly in the sky
let us go into the sky
let us walk
i hear her voice in leaves
she lies in a wild flower
a butterfly tune
i love you as if everything that exists

you are the smallest one thing
you are a beautiful conversation
your body makes me hold your heart


AMBIGUOUS POEM (3RD PART):
BAR 57 - END

i know that rarity precedes extinction
like that of the purple orchid in my garden
its jealousy unyielding as the Tuscan mid the snow
As the perfumed tincture of the heart where I have roots
For I want as deep a dye

the sun shines on the hills
and all the wind blows terribly and everything is there
remember the sun does not know
the moon is a little bird
who makes us fly
like a bridge of fire
to fly away from the hills

if you could be a dream
if you could be found in your mind
it is not a dream of light
it carries your heart

the sun simmers
elemental rays
time is always there
is always
and the sun does not reach

you know what you are
you are always falling leaves on the ground
don't you know your life is like a tree
i know that i am not a poem i want to be bothered by

i see softly the light
i feel the scent
Dancing in the wind
the sun is going
we go down
the sea is going
we go down
the sky grows in a warm light
i looked at night and round the sun
and the sun does not reach
